This Github Repo is used to keep track of issues that the VR development ommunity would like to see addressed as a video on the [FusedVR Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/fuseman). If you have a request, either report it as an issue on Github or Waffle and we will categorize them as we get to requests.
